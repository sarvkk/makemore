## Makemore: Language Modeling

### Introduction

Makemore is a project focused on building character-level language models. This project starts with a simple bigram model and progressively enhances its complexity using neural network architectures.

Implementations

1. Bigram Character-Level Language Model

Implemented a bigram-based language model that learns character transition probabilities.

This serves as the foundational model to be further improved with neural networks.

2. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Character-Level Language Model

Implemented an MLP-based character-level language model.

Referenced "A Neural Probabilistic Language Model" by Yoshua Bengio et al.

Uses learned embeddings and a feedforward network to improve character prediction compared to the bigram model.
